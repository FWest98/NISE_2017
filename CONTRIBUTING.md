This version of the NISE code is actively developed. The structure of the code has been changed compared to previous
versions to allow easier development and contributions. The goal is to include more spectroscopic techniques than
present in previous versions. Feel free to contact the main author if you have ideas for new improvements or additions
or if you developed a code that can be beneficial to add.
